# AUTOMATE
Automatic Multi-gravity Assist trajectory design with Tisserand Exploration (AUTOMATE) is a toolbox developed at Cranfield University to automatize the process of estimating MGA trajectories by using information from the Tisserand graphs. This information can then be used to reduce the search space and computational effort of an optimisation software.
When running a search, the software will return all Multi-Gravity Assist (MGA) trajectories that are energetically feasible between the departure and arrival planets selected by the user. Estimations of relevant information such as infinity velocity, time of flight and launch date are provided for each sequence obtained. 

This tool was developped by Hadrien AFSA, first as a MSc Thesis for Cranfield University, and was later improved to add more flexibility and reliability in its results. A paper was published at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) 2022 and will be uploaded soon. The Interactive Presentation describing the work can be found [here](https://iac2022-iaf.ipostersessions.com/default.aspx?s=14-69-EB-EA-E3-D5-DE-EF-FC-5B-08-44-BD-16-66-C5).

# Software required
AUTOMATE was developped using MatLab 2021. Most versions of MatLab should be able to run it.

# How to use it
Simply execute the AUTOMATE.m file in the MatLab environment. 
The settings of the search can be changed in the file.
