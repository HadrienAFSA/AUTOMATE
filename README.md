# AUTOMATE
Automatic Multi-gravity Assist trajectory design with Tisserand Exploration (AUTOMATE) is a toolbox developed at Cranfield University to automatize the process of estimating MGA trajectories by using information from the Tisserand graphs. This information can then be used to reduce the search space and computational effort of an optimisation software.

# What software is required
AUTOMATE was developped using MatLab 2021. Most versions of MatLab should be able to run it.

# How to use it
Simply execute the AUTOMATE.m file in the MatLab environment. 
The settings of the search can be changed in the file.
